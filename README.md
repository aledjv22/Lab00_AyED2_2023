# Laboratory 00 of Algorithms and Data Structure II
This laboratory consists of completing the code of 2 programs by understanding them, another objective is the practice of writing code in C.

## Bounds
This program allows the user to enter a number N of elements for an array which, after indicating their integer values and an element to be compared, is shown on the screen if the element to be compared is upper bound, lower bound, minimum or maximum and if being minimum or maximum shows what position it is in.

## Tictactoe
This program allows two people to play the famous game **tictactoe** (game information in this [link](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tres_en_l%C3%ADnea "link")) on a board of size NxN, The size can be modified by changing the value of **N on line 7** of the code **in tictactoe.c**.

## Commands:

### $make
This command compiles the **.c** files of the programs creating the executables **tateti** and **bounds**.

### $make run_tictactoe
This command runs the **tateti** executable starting the **game**.

### $make run_bounds
This command runs the bounds executable starting the program.

### $make clean
This command removes the **tateti** and **bounds** executables.
